                <h3>Lemonade Insurance Company</h3>

                <p>This is a screenshot of Lemonade Insurance's homepage</p>
                <p>You can immediately notice the call to action button from Lemonade Insurance. Their use of pink against a black and white background makes 
                    the button and the link below it standout. This makes it easy for the user to decide. Their clean and minimal use of black font with the white background
                    makes the message easy to read and understand.</p>

                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <h3>Evernote Corporation</h3>

                <p>This is a screenshot of Evernote's homepage.</p>
                <p>Evernote has good visual hierarchy. They have utilized the F-shaped reading pattern. The main headline "Your notes. Organized. Effortless." 
                    stands out by its scale and helps the reader to understand how the app can help them. They have also included a sign-up button with good
                    contrast. Doing so helps the user to have decide to act by clicking the button. Lastly, they have added a snippet of a picture below which
                    makes the user curious enough to scroll down if they are still not convinced with the message that they have just read.</p>

                <h2>Repetition</h2>
                <h3>Grab Philippines</h3>

                <img class="size" src="/lesson2/images/Grab.PNG" alt="a screenshot of Grab's homepage">

                <p>This is a screenshot of Grab's homepage</p>
                <p>Grab's branding is shown throughout their whole website. Their use of their green brand color, fonts, and other visuals such as in the picture 
                    above helped create a good experience for the user. It is easy to figure out what they are selling. Through repeating the designs of each picture, they were 
                    able to closely connect each service even if they are different in certain ways.</p>
