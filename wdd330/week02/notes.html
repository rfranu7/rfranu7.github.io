                I have seen code snippets where map, reduce and filter have been used before. It's not something that I have a great deal of experience
                in using. I am interested in learning more about it.

                I also have learned one possible use case for callbacks when I met with my group this week. Rolando Rodriguez said that he has used it at
                his job before and showed us how we can use it in our team activity. He showed us how we can handle errors in the input using callback and
                that opened up my mind to some more possibilities.

                I unfortunately had a little less time for school activity as I have been very busy at work due to the deadline of our project is coming up soon.
                This is something that I am planning to put into practice next week.
